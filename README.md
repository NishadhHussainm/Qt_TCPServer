# TCP Server using Qt in C++

This project demonstrates a TCP server application built using the Qt framework in C++. It allows communication between multiple clients connected to the server, sending messages and attachments.

## Features

- **Server functionality:** The server is capable of handling multiple client connections concurrently.
- **Message exchange:** Clients can send text messages to each other or broadcast to all connected clients.
- **Attachment transfer:** Clients can send files (such as JSON, text, PNG, JPEG, etc.) to each other or broadcast to all connected clients.

## Setup

### Requirements

- **Qt Framework:** Ensure you have Qt installed. You can download it from [Qt's official website](https://www.qt.io/download).

### Building and Running
* Open the project in Qt Creator.

* Build the project by selecting the appropriate build configuration.

* Run the server application.

### Usage
* Start the server application.
* Connect client applications to the server using the specified IP address and port (default port is 8080).
* Use the provided GUI to send messages or attachments to specific clients or broadcast to all connected clients.
### Troubleshooting
* If encountering issues with the server startup or client connections, ensure the correct IP address and port are used.
* Check for any error messages displayed by the application.

## About 
* TCP server is a program or a device that provides services to other programs or devices known as clients.
* It waits and listens for incoming connection requests from clients and responds to those requests.
* It typically operates on a well-defined port number and continuously runs, waiting for clients to establish connections.
* Once a client connects, the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously or in sequence, depending on its design
